	abstract = {This review starts with a short introduction on the physical motivations for a new class of elementary particle detectors, known as bolometers, in which the detection is mediated by the production of phonons in a dielectric or superconductive material. Successively, the basic principles of these devices are exposed. In the next section the thermalization dynamics of the energy released in the absorber is analysed; the physics of the most common phonon sensors, doped semiconductors working in the variable range hopping conduction regime, is then discussed in depth. The last section is an outlook on the most important experimental results obtained with bolometers. Special attention is devoted to the materials (and to the related physical implications) chosen to realize the energy absorbers of the detectors.},

	abstract = {We present a method for using solid state detectors with directional sensitivity to dark matter interactions to detect low-mass Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ({WIMPs}) originating from galactic sources. In spite of a large body of literature for high-mass {WIMP} detectors with directional sensitivity, there is no available technique to cover {WIMPs} in the mass range {\textless}1 {GeV}. We argue that single-electron resolution semiconductor detectors allow for directional sensitivity once properly calibrated. We examine commonly used semiconductor material response to these low-mass {WIMP} interactions.},

	abstract = {{SuperCDMS} is an experiment designed to directly detect Weakly Interacting Massive Particles ({WIMPs}), a favored candidate for dark matter ubiquitous in the Universe. In this paper, we present {WIMP}-search results using a calorimetric technique we call {CDMSlite}, which relies on voltage- assisted Luke-Neganov amplification of the ionization energy deposited by particle interactions. The data were collected with a single 0.6 kg germanium detector running for 10 live days at the Soudan Underground Laboratory. A low energy threshold of 170 {eVee} (electron equivalent) was obtained, which allows us to constrain new {WIMP}-nucleon spin-independent parameter space for {WIMP} masses below 6 {GeV}/c2.},

	abstract = {The discrepancies in claims of experimental evidence in the search for weakly interacting massive particle ({WIMP}) dark matter necessitate a model for ionization efﬁciency (the quenching factor) at energies below 10 {keV}. We have carefully studied the physics processes that contribute to the ionization efﬁciency through stopping power. The focus of this work is the construction of a model for the ionization efﬁciency in germanium by analyzing the components of stopping power, speciﬁcally that of the nuclear stopping power, at low energies. We ﬁnd a fraction of the {ZBL} nuclear stopping power can contribute to ionization efﬁciency. We propose a model that corrects the missing contribution to ionization efﬁciency from the {ZBL} nuclear stopping power. The proposed model is compared to previous measurements of ionization efﬁciency in germanium as well as that of other theoretical models. Using this new model, the thresholds of both {CDMS} {II} and {CoGeNT} are analyzed and compared in terms of the nuclear recoil energy.},
